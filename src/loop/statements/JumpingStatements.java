		//1. break statement: used to terminate the current loop or switch statement and transfer execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
		//2. continue statement: used to skip the current iteration of a loop and transfer execution to the beginning of the next iteration of the loop.
		//3. return statement: used to exit from a method and optionally return a value to the caller.
